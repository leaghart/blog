This is an attempt to create a static page blog using Hugo for upload onto Unstoppable Domains as NFT website</p>
A Go Daddy DNS based webiste will be linked to the Unstoppable Domain & Hugo static pages</p>
The idea is that the static pages linking through the DNS will index on Google and rank for SEO along with deeplinks and backlinks</p>
Simultaneously, since the site is not web-hosted, the content itself is not indexed, leaving the links clean from SEO keywords from third party backlinks</p>

My hope is to create a website that can rank on search engines, while being secure from malicious backlinks</p>
If the concept proves true, it will be used for PR efforts</p>

Here goes nothing...
